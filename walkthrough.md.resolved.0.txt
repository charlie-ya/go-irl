# Multi-Computer Sync Guide

This guide explains how to keep your **goIRL** project synchronized between your home and work computers.

## Computer 1 (Current Machine)
We have already:
1.  Initialized the repository.
2.  Committed all local files.
3.  Added the remote link.

**Action Required:**
If the push didn't happen automatically (due to missing credentials), open your terminal and run:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
*Enter your GitHub credentials if prompted.*

## Computer 2 (New Machine)
To start working on the second computer:

1.  Open your terminal/command prompt.
2.  Navigate to where you want the project.
3.  Run the clone command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/charlie-ya/go-irl.git
    ```
4.  Enter the directory:
    ```bash
    cd go-irl
    ```
5.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Daily Workflow
### Before starting work (on either machine)
Always get the latest changes first:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### After finishing work
Save your changes and upload them:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push origin main
```
